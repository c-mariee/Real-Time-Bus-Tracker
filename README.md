# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project reflects a map of the Boston / Cambridge area and one of the bus routes that is available in the area. The initial project was to add a marker to the map. I have now made that market yellow (bus color), added the route as magenta, and color coded each bus stop along the way that the yellow marker will pass.
